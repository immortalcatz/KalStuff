# KalStuff
Files for a mod that adds random stuff.

If anyone has any good ideas for the mod, put them here, under the Suggestions section, along with your name if you want. To keep things organized, if you decide to implement an idea from here write a comment saying that you are doing so before you start. Example: " - add Cheetos(Chester): FritoLay is working on it". Once a feature is finished and implemented, please change the status to "[Finished]" and move it over to the Finished Suggestions section. Example: " - add dumplings: [Finished]"

UPDATE: We're trying to keep everything in KalStuff unique. Please, if you add an idea, make sure that it hasn't been done before. And if it has, make sure that your take on it is really unique(soda sipping is a good example). Thanks.
